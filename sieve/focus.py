"""Query-focused content filtering for smart_fetch and include_content.

When the agent passes ``focus="..."``, the extracted markdown is filtered to
the blocks (paragraphs / headings / tables / lists / code) most relevant to the
query, so the agent loads less context on long pages. Inspired by Crawl4AI's
BM25ContentFilter, enhanced with heading-aware boosting + table/code preservation.

Design choice: focus runs **post-cache**. The full extracted text is cached
once per URL; different focus queries are just different views over the same
cached content, so focusing never causes a re-fetch and two different focuses
on the same URL share one cache entry. Filtering happens inside
``_apply_chunking`` (the universal final wrapper), so it applies to live
fetches, cache hits, and bulk results alike.

Three improvements over plain BM25:

1. **Heading-aware section relevance**: When a markdown heading contains query
   terms, ALL blocks under that heading (until the next heading) are selected and
   get a 1.5x score boost. Headings define topic boundaries - if a heading says
   "Model Architecture" and the query mentions "architecture", content under that
   heading is relevant even if individual paragraphs don't contain the exact word
   "architecture". No other search tool does this.

2. **Table/code preservation**: Tables and code blocks get BM25-underweighted
   (table cells are short tokens, code has unusual token distribution). But they
   are HIGH-VALUE for factual queries. Tables and code blocks containing ANY
   query term are always kept, regardless of BM25 score. This prevents losing
   the actual data table while keeping prose paragraphs that discuss it.

3. **BM25 (k1=1.5, b=0.75)** with always-positive IDF (the ``+1`` inside the log)
   so a block with a single query-term occurrence gets a positive score and is
   kept at the default threshold. A heading immediately preceding a kept block is
   preserved for context. If nothing clears the threshold, the closest blocks are
   kept so the agent gets something to judge instead of an empty page.
